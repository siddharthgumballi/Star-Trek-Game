;; ============================================================================
;; BRIDGE INTERIOR SCENE
;; ============================================================================
;;
;; This scene creates a detailed Enterprise-D bridge interior.
;; All geometry is generated procedurally by the script.
;;
;; PLACEMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
;; -----------------------
;; The bridge should be positioned relative to your Enterprise-D model.
;; On the Galaxy-class, the bridge is located at the top of the saucer section.
;;
;; Typical offset from ship origin: Vector3(0, 8, -40)
;; (Adjust based on your specific model's scale and orientation)
;;
;; SCALE NOTES:
;; ------------
;; The bridge is built at 1 unit = 1 meter scale.
;; Bridge diameter: ~12 meters
;; Bridge height: ~3 meters
;;
;; If your ship model uses a different scale, adjust the bridge's scale
;; property accordingly, or modify the constants in the script.
;;
;; CUSTOMIZATION:
;; --------------
;; - Colors can be adjusted via the exported properties in the Inspector
;; - To add textures: Replace StandardMaterial3D with textured materials
;; - To use custom meshes: Replace the MeshInstance3D creations with
;;   loaded PackedScenes or .glb imports
;;
;; CAMERA INTEGRATION:
;; -------------------
;; Use get_bridge_camera_position() and get_bridge_look_target() for
;; positioning a first-person bridge camera.
;;
;; ALERT MODES:
;; ------------
;; Call set_alert_status("red"), set_alert_status("yellow"), or
;; set_alert_status("normal") to change the bridge lighting.
